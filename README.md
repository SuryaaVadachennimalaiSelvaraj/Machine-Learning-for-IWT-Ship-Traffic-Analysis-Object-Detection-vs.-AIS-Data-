# Machine Learning for IWT Ship Traffic Analysis Object Detection vs AIS Data
## Description
The main goal of this research study is to look into how object detection algorithms could be used with video surveillance and satellite images to deal with problems caused by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data that overlaps or is faked in maritime settings. The first research question focuses on evaluating the accuracy and performance of the object detection algorithm in identifying and localizing ships in diverse maritime conditions and environments. By comparing the algorithm's results with ground-truth data, researchers seek to understand the algorithm's reliability in ship detection. The second research question delves into understanding the discrepancies and variations between the ship detections obtained through the object detection algorithm and the existing AIS data. This step involves quantifying and analyzing the differences to gain insights into potential instances of overlapping or spoofed AIS data. Finally, the third research question explores the potential benefits and challenges of integrating video surveillance and satellite-derived ship detections with the AIS data. The study aims to determine whether this integration can enhance the detection and identification of overlapping or spoofed AIS information while also considering the limitations and obstacles that may arise during the process. By addressing these research questions, the study aims to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable maritime monitoring systems and improve the overall safety and security of maritime operations.
This file will discuss steps to execute the code for object identification, the results of which would be compared with the existing AIS data to test for anomalies.
