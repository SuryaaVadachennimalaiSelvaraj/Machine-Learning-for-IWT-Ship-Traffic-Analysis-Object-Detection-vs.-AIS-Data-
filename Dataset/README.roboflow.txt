The dataset includes 85 images.
Inland-water-vessels are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 6 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -50 and +50 percent
